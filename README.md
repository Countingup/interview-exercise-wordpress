# Countingup Wordpress Exercise

## Overview
Thank you for choosing to interview with Countingup for our Wordpress Developer role. We hope you find the experience 
interesting and rewarding.

Our technical interview takes the form of a pairing exercise, where you will be expected to work with a member of our
team to code a solution to the problem outlined in the exercise you will be given. There will then be a some follow up
questions and an opportunity for you to ask us questions too. Whils the core problem to be solved is relatively trivial,
the exercise is designed for you to showcase your skills and to demonstrate how quickly you can learn something new.

## Prerequisites 
We would ask that you have [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed and that you choose an
appropriate IDE to implement your solution.

If you wish to use ESNext when writing your custom block, we would ask that you have `npm` installed.

## Implementation
The custom block can be either implemented using ES5 or ESNext depending on which syntax you are more comfortable with.
This skeleton has the scripts required to use ESNext but please use whichever you are more comfortable with.
